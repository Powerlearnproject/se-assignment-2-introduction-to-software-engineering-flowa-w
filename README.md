# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the systematsic application of engineering principles, method and tools that is into the development and maintainance of high-quality systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):It is the cost effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software.
Software engineering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software, from conception to maintenance, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to software development

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: agile is interative and incremental approach focused on flexibility and collaboratin and responding to change.
waterfall is the sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements , design and implementations.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
It is a systematic and strict approach to the definition, creation, and verification of requirements for a software system. It helps to ensure that the software system meets the needs of all stakeholders.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
It is a design priciple aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the components of a system.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
-unit testing; where each component is tested individually to ensure their impartiality and analyze their functionality.
-intergration testing; enables software testers to test group units integrated into a system or subsystems.
-system testing; is performed on an integrated environment comprising the whole application, where all components are assessed against specific business requirements.
-acceptance testing; involves testing the systemâ€™s Functional and Non-functional aspects, such as performance, security, usability, accessibility, compatibility, and reliability.
testing is crucial so that end-users get what they want and meet their expectations.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
It is a system that tracks the progress of code across the software development lifecycle.
They provide co-ordination, sharing and collaboration.
example include GitHub mostly tracks changes in codes.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
To make sure the project is successful from start to end. 
Poor project planning.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
 It is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs.
 Types we have; corrective, adaptive, perfective and preventive maintainance.
 Maitainance is very essential because it improves system performance.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Accountability, privacy preferences and honesty, etc.
They should make themselves trusted and have confidence in their work.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
